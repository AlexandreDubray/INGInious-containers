Sekexe container (ingi/inginious-containers-sekexe)
---------------------------------------------------

Sekexe is a tool made by Jérôme Petazzoni.
https://github.com/jpetazzo/sekexe.git

This container runs scripts inside an UML. That allows to bypass some Docker's restrictions.

We use it at INGI to allow to run packetdrill inside docker.
